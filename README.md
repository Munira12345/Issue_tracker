GitHub Issue Tracker
A GitHub Issue Tracker mobile app prototype developed with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that interacts with GitHub's GraphQL API to track issues, manage state, and implement filtering, search, and tagging functionality. The app follows modern Android development principles with robust CI/CD practices and testing.

Features
State Management: Using Jetpack Compose to handle UI state with LiveData and ViewModel.
GraphQL Integration: Communicates with GitHub's GraphQL API to fetch, search, and filter issues.
Filters & Search: Users can filter issues by tags and search for issues by keywords.
Tagging System: Provides a tagging feature to categorize issues.
Offline-first Support: Uses Room for local data persistence, enabling offline access and synchronization.
Authentication: Implements OAuth2 authentication for accessing protected GitHub data.
Error Reporting & Alerts: Integrates observability and error reporting tools for production environments.
Automated Testing: Full test suite including unit tests, UI tests, and integration tests.
Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD): Uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
Play Store Ready: Follows the full app development lifecycle, from wireframing and design to publishing on Google Play Store.

Visual Design
The app showcases a clean, intuitive UI with the following design considerations:

Material Design principles for a cohesive and native Android look.
Layouts & Styling optimized for various screen sizes and orientations.
Typography and color schemes that ensure a polished user experience.

UX Design Process
The app was built following key UX design techniques, including:
Wireframing: Initial wireframes were created to map out the user journey.
Prototyping: An interactive prototype helped validate design choices.
Usability Testing: Testing was done to refine the UI flow and interactions.

Authentication
Supports OAuth 2 for user authentication, ensuring secure access to the GitHub API. Additional authentication methods, including OpenID Connect and JWT, are also supported.

Tech Stack
Kotlin: Main programming language.
Jetpack Compose: For building UIs declaratively.
Apollo GraphQL: To interact with GitHubâ€™s GraphQL API.
Room: For local data storage and offline functionality.
Retrofit: To handle REST API calls, if necessary.
JUnit: For unit tests.
Mockito: For mocking in tests.
GitHub Actions: For CI/CD, automated testing, and deployment.
Testing
The app includes a comprehensive suite of automated tests:

Unit Tests: Ensuring individual components function as expected.
UI Tests: Testing user interactions with Compose UI.
Integration Tests: Verifying the app's interaction with the GitHub GraphQL API.
End-to-End Tests: Testing the entire user flow from fetching issues to filtering and searching.
The CI/CD pipeline automatically runs these tests on every pull request, using GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

Offline-first Architecture
Using Room for data persistence ensures that users can access issue data even when offline. The app synchronizes data with GitHub when connectivity is restored, using efficient data reconciliation techniques.

Observability and Error Handling
The app incorporates error reporting and alerting tools to monitor performance and catch issues in the production environment. This includes logging and alerts for critical failures.

Deployment
The app is set up for continuous deployment:

Firebase App Distribution is used for beta testing and distributing pre-release versions.
GitHub Actions automates the build, test, and deployment processes.
Google Play Store: Once ready, the app is published to the Play Store for user download.
